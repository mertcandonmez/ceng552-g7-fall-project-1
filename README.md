# CENG552: Fall Project 1
Task: Completed and Write Unit Tests to this report 

The codes written in the forked repo do not belong to us. As homework, we made the forked code executable and used testing techniques to write unit tests on it and measure branch coverage. The following explanations are the explanations of the original repo.

# student Marks Management Project

## the objectives project
- to enhance your knowledge in Object Oriented Programming
- best practices to make a flexible and maintainable code
  ## description problem
we try to manage the student marks given by different teachers in a specific module. 

each **student** is characterized by :
- id (auto increment)
- full Name student
- date of birth
- group(MSIR ,MIAD,. . . )

each **teacher** is characterized by :
- id (auto increment)
- full name teacher
- grade (,MCA,MCB..)
- list modules that he/she teaches
- list of the attached group which he/she teaches

each **group** is characterized by :
- reference group
- number of students

each **module** is characterized by :
- reference
- name
- number of hours

each **mark** is characterized by :
- an integer value between (5-20) which is given by a teacher to a student in a specific module

  ### in addition
1. each **teacher** can teach one or more **groups**.
2. May **the teacher** teach more than one **module**.
3. each **student** is attached to a single **group**.
4. each **mark** is related to a single **student** in a specific **module**.
5. donâ€™t forget to update the total number of students in the group class when you add or delete a student.

##  How i can organize my project? 
from the above description we create five packages, each one has  classes that do specific tasks
- package 1 module
- package 2 group
- package 3 student
- package 4 teacher
- package 5 mark
